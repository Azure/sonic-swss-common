# SONiC - SWitch State Service Common Library - SWSS-COMMON

## Description
The SWitch State Service (SWSS) common library provides libraries for database communications, netlink wrappers, and other functions needed by SWSS.

## Getting Started

### Build from Source

Checkout the source:

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/sonic-net/sonic-swss-common


Install build dependencies:

    sudo apt-get install make libtool m4 autoconf dh-exec debhelper cmake pkg-config \
                         libhiredis-dev libnl-3-dev libnl-genl-3-dev libnl-route-3-dev \
                         libnl-nf-3-dev swig3.0 libpython2.7-dev libpython3-dev \
                         libgtest-dev libgmock-dev libboost-dev

Build and Install Google Test and Mock from DEB source packages:

    cd /usr/src/gtest && sudo cmake . && sudo make

You can compile and install from source using:

    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure
    make && sudo make install

You can also build a debian package using:

    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure
    dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc -b

### Build with Google Test
1. Rebuild with Google Test
```
$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure --enable-debug 'CXXFLAGS=-O0 -g'
$ make clean
$ GCC_COLORS=1 make
```

2. Start redis server if not yet:
```
sudo sed -i 's/notify-keyspace-events ""/notify-keyspace-events AKE/' /etc/redis/redis.conf
sudo service redis-server start
```

3. Run unit test:
```
tests/tests
```

## Contribution guide

Please read the [contributors guide](https://github.com/sonic-net/SONiC/blob/gh-pages/CONTRIBUTING.md) for information about how to contribute.

All contributors must sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement (ICLA)](https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/lfx/easycla/v2-current/contributors/individual-contributor) before contributions can be accepted. This process is managed by the [Linux Foundation - EasyCLA](https://easycla.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/) and automated
via a GitHub bot. If the contributor has not yet signed a CLA, the bot will create a comment on the pull request containing a link to electronically sign the CLA.

### GitHub Workflow

We're following basic GitHub Flow. If you have no idea what we're talking about, check out [GitHub's official guide](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/). Note that merge is only performed by the repository maintainer.

Guide for performing commits:

* Isolate each commit to one component/bugfix/issue/feature
* Use a standard commit message format:

>     [component/folder touched]: Description intent of your changes
>
>     [List of changes]
>
> 	  Signed-off-by: Your Name your@email.com

For example:

>     swss-common: Stabilize the ConsumerTable
>
>     * Fixing autoreconf
>     * Fixing unit-tests by adding checkers and initialize the DB before start
>     * Adding the ability to select from multiple channels
>     * Health-Monitor - The idea of the patch is that if something went wrong with the notification channel,
>       we will have the option to know about it (Query the LLEN table length).
>
>       Signed-off-by: user@dev.null


* Each developer should fork this repository and [add the team as a Contributor](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository)
* Push your changes to your private fork and do "pull-request" to this repository
* Use a pull request to do code review
* Use issues to keep track of what is going on


## Native Redis connections for language clients

Client authentication belongs to the C++ implementation in this repository.
`openRedisUnixSocket(path, connect_timeout_ms, auth_timeout_ms)` opens and
matches the requested Unix endpoint, performs writer login when authorized,
and returns an owned close-on-exec file descriptor without selecting a DB.
A caller without credential access keeps the default reader account. The
caller closes the descriptor; credentials do not cross the binding boundary.

Python raw-client operations can use `swsscommon.redis.connection_pool()`.
Pass database, encoding and socket timeout options to that pool, then pass it
to `redis.Redis(connection_pool=pool)`. Each pool connection authenticates in
C++ before redis-py performs SELECT or application commands, including after
reconnect. Use DBConnector, SonicV2Connector or ConfigDBConnector directly when
their existing operations meet the caller's needs.

The Go package `goext/redisconn` wraps the C API and returns a `net.Conn` from
`openRedisUnixSocketInterruptible`. The native factory uses nonblocking socket
I/O and waits for either Redis or a cancellation descriptor during connect and
AUTH. One timeout covers both phases. Go signals cancellation through a pipe
and joins its watcher before returning; native socket ownership and credential
handling remain in C++. Cancelled or expired contexts return `context.Canceled`
or `context.DeadlineExceeded`, including when a native error races the context
timer. Cancelling after a successful dial leaves the returned connection usable.

`WrapDialer` preserves TCP/TLS and custom TCP dialers, but rejects custom Unix
dialers and TLS on Unix sockets. The existing Unix factory and Rust `OwnedFd`
interface are unchanged. These bindings do not read policy or credential files.

`checkRedisTcpEndpoint` applies the native policy's rejection of selected TCP
writer endpoints before a raw client's normal TCP/TLS dialing. Protected TCP
remains outside this Unix-only implementation.

`exportRedisRdb` uses the native Unix factory and streams a SYNC snapshot to a
temporary file with mode 0600. It replaces the requested destination only after
the full advertised payload has arrived and been synced to disk. This preserves
native RDB output without passing a password to redis-cli or to Python.

Run `tests/run-redis-auth-tests.sh` as root in an isolated test container. The
runner compiles a separate library with a temporary policy path; production
packages retain their fixed runtime path. Python bindings and the Go package
must be built against the matching native headers and library. These component
checks do not establish installed-image or hardware qualification.
